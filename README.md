# Snakes_and_Ladder_Game
### Introduction
Generally, Snake & Ladder Game is a game which is played with board and dice. But I try to make this different. That’s why I started to make this game. I use C language to make the game. I have to use graphics in this game.

In this game, player has to just press any key to roll the dice. That is very easy task for the player. Some snake and ladder has to use in this game. Those are totally made of graphics.

This game has some limitation. I will be try to overcome this limitation in recent future. I will be try to make this game better in next version.
